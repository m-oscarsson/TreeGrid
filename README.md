# TreeGrid

Basics are borrowed from TreeRelationships
https://github.com/ashlega/ITAintBoring.PCFControls/tree/master/Controls/TreeRelationships

Adapted to fit any hierarchical relationsship in Dynamics 365 CE

Parent lookup: The field name to the closest parent on the record
Root lookup: The field name of the root lookup on the record
Tree Node Name: The field that is used as a display name in the tree

The grid looks up the root and builds the tree from there. A click on any node will open up that record in the same window.
